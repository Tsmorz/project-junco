## About the program
I tried to be very complete in creating a useful model to streamline the initial design phase. The model is not without assumptions but (in my opinion) represents a helpful tool in novel a/c design.
\
\
Some physical phenomenon that are modeled include:
  - Skin friction drag with a boundary layer theory.
  - Form drag from airfoil data
  - FAA structural loading limits
  - Disk loading to estimate hovering power costs
  - Taper ratio and induced drag
  - Euler bending beam theory for thin structures (torsion and bending)
  - Battery considerations for electric flight
