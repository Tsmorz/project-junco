## About the program
I tried to be very complete in creating a useful model to streamline the initial design phase. The model is not without assumptions but (in my opinion) represents a helpful tool in novel a/c design.
\
\
Some physical phenomenon that are modeled include:
  - Skin friction drag with a boundary layer theory.
  - Form drag from airfoil data
  - FAA structural loading limits
  - Disk loading to estimate hovering power costs
  - Taper ratio and induced drag
  - Euler bending beam theory for thin structures (torsion and bending)
  - Battery considerations for electric flight

## Jetson Nano - Setup
1. Download and install the SD card image onto the Nano. Official instructions on [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#write).
2. Increase the swap on the Nano. Official instructions on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/uvU8AXY1170).
3. Update the Jetson Nano
```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
4.
```
$ sudo apt install python-pip python3-pip
```
